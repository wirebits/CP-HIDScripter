# üêçCP-HIDScripter

# ‚ÑπÔ∏èAbout
CP-HIDScripter (CircuitPython-HIDScripter) is a web tool that generates circuitpython HID scripts using Mnemonics.

# ‚è≥Working
It basically converts the mnemonics with values into circuitpython scripts so that it directly store on flash memory to perform keystroke injection.

# ‚ú®Features
- Simple and clean GUI.
- Two large windows one for mnemonics and other for circuitpython script.
- Convert Button : Convert mnemonics into circuit python scripts.
- Copy Button : Copy circuitpython script to the clipboard so that it can paste anywhere.
- Reset Button : Clear all text from both windows.
- Save Button : Save circuitpython scripts on the system for future use.
- From Button : Upload `.txt` files which contain mnemonics to load on mnemonics window.

# ‚úÖSupported Boards
- Those boards which support `CircuitPython` and it supports `usb_hid` module.

>[!TIP]
> Use those boards which have atleast `2MB` flash memory.

>[!CAUTION]
> - Some boards does not have built-in UF2 bootloader.  
> - It need to flash UF2 bootloader to allows you to flash your firmware by just dragging and dropping `.uf2` file onto the flash drive without using an external programmer.  
> - Check CircuitPython page of that board.  
> - At the end of the page, if it contain link for bootloader `.bin` file, that means it does not have built-in UF2 bootloader.

# üì¶Requirements
- `1` Your Board
- `1` Micro-B USB / Type-C USB Cable with data transfer support

# ‚öôÔ∏èSetup CircuitPython
1. Open Official CircuitPython download link from [here](https://circuitpython.org/downloads).
2. Search your board you have.
3. Select your board and click on it.
4. Download latest stable release CircuitPython `.uf2` file and noted its version.
   - It is like `X.Y.Z`.
   - Latest stable release is `9.2.9` but it can be changed in future so keep eye on it.
5. Connect your board with Micro-B USB / Type-C USB Cable and then connect it to the PC/Laptop.
   - It is shown as Mass Storage Device with some name.
6. Copy the `.uf2` file into the board mass storage device.
   - When it is copied, then it disconnects automatically and reconnect as `CIRCUITPY`.
7. Done! CircuitPython is successfully flashed in the your board.

# ‚öôÔ∏èSetup Essential Files
1. Make sure that your board is connected to your PC/Laptop.
2. Download latest Adafruit CircuitPython Bundle from [here](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).
   - There are `2` variants of libraries : `Bundles` and `The Community Bundle`.
   - In Bundles variant, download latest stable Adafruit CircuitPython Bundle as noted version of `.uf2` file.
   - Latest stable release is `adafruit-circuitpython-bundle-9.x-mpy-20250829.zip` but it can be changed in future so keep eye on it.
3. Extarct the ZIP file.
4. Go to the `lib` folder in the extracted ZIP file.
5. Copy `adafruit_hid` folders in the `lib` folder of `CIRCUITPY`.
6. Done! Now, your board is ready to use as a DIY USB Rubber Ducky.

# üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èRun `DIY USB Rubber Ducky`
1. Make sure that your board is connected to your PC/Laptop and it has essential files.
2. Open CP-HIDScripter from [here]().
3. Type mnemonics in mnemonics window.
4. Click on `Convert` button.
   - The corresponding CircuitPython script is generated.
5. Click on `Save` button.
   - It generates a file named `code.py`.
   - It is default file in `CIRCUITPY` so that when powered the board, this file is running.
   - It ask for replacement of `code.py` file, then replace it.
   - It will overwrite in the `code.py` file.
6. Done! As `code.py` saved in it, the script executes automatically.

>[!TIP]
> Start your code with `WAIT` so that board get time to initiate.
>Time must be atleast `1000`.
